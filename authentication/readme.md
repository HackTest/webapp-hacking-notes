# authentication hacking

### SQL Injection
**Description**  
Hacker uses 'strange' username to bypass password validation and get unauthenticatedd access to user's account.

**Case Analysis**  
Suppose in webapp backend, the authentication logic is as follows.

Case 1: Correct SQL Syntax | Access to User's account
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='alice@example.com' and password='abc'
```
If we add an extra ' to the SQL query, the backend will throw an execption and the user will be rejected to get access to the account.

Case 2: Incorrect SQL Syntax | No Access to User's account
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='alice@example.com'' and password='abc'
```
However, if the hacker input a tricky username, it will comment out the password validation and the backend will throw no exception.

Case 3: Incorrect SQL Syntax | Access to User's account
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='alice@example.com' -- ' and password='abc'
```
which is equivalent to 
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='alice@example.com'
```

**Defend**  
Sanitization is a good way to defend the SQL  injection. By using the placeholder of variables, if the password is missing, it will throw exceptions, which make SQL injection fail.
```
dbQuery("SELECT * FROM users where email=? and password=?â€œ);
dbBindParameters("ss", $email, $password);
dbStatementExecute();
```

### Dictionary Attack
**Description**  
It generally means automated password guessing.

**Case Analysis**  
1. Hacker uses social engineer methods and know user's account name: alice@example.com  
2. Hacker uses list of common passwords to attempt loggin
3. Hack waits for web app's response to see whether the password is correct or not

**Hydra** is a good tool to automate dictionary attack. A typical script is like this: 
```
hydra example.com -L emails.txt -P passwords.txt https-post-form "/login.php:email=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid password" -S
```

**Defend**  
**CAPTCHA** is commonly used to defend dictionary attack. Since it provide some easy tests (visual recognition) to tell if the user is a real person or computer.

### HTTPS Enforcement
**Description**  
Web Application should always redirect a http request to a https request.

**Case Analysis**  
HTTPS NOT ENFORCED: http://example.com/login.php => http://example.com/login.php  
HTTPS ENFORCED: http://example.com/login.php => https://example.com/login.php  

**Summary**  
HTTP is insecure because the credential is transmitted in plaintext. We should always use HTTPS protocal to protect user's privacy.
